The Semantic_search.ipynb notebook appears to be focused on implementing a semantic search system using NLP techniques. Here's a brief summary of its content:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Importing necessary libraries and downloading datasets and resources, such as the Reuters dataset and stopwords.
Preprocessing text data, including lowercasing, tokenization, and stemming.
Feature Extraction:

Using TF-IDF vectorization to extract features from the text data.
Identifying important keywords and their associated TF-IDF scores.
Data Splitting:

Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
Cosine Similarity and Nearest Neighbors:

Computing cosine similarity between document vectors.
Implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification using cosine similarity as the distance metric.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the model's accuracy and other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization:

Visualizing model performance metrics using plots.
